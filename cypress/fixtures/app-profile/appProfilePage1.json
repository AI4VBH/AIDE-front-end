Image registration and super resolution methods are used to convert multiple stacks of 2D MRI slices into a fully motion-corrected 3D MRI volume. Two deep learning tasks are performed using 3D UNet neural networks, which negates the need for manual intervention by the radiographer or clinician. The first 3D UNet performs automatic segmentation of the foetal brain. The second 3D UNet performs automatic reorientation of the foetal brain into a standard radiographic orientation appropriate for clinical reporting.",
